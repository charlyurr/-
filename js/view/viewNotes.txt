This folder contains files responsible for rendering 
the UI elements and handling user interactions. You might have a
geojsonView.js file to render 
GeoJSON features on the map and handle drag and drop interactions.


View: The view is responsible for rendering the data to the user
 interface. It includes elements like maps and tooltips. 
 The function addPolygonHoverTooltip would be part of the view 
 layer, as it deals with the presentation and interaction aspects.
